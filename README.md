# WeightedPairedScheduling

Just initialize the list and give the parameters:
  - How many times do you want it to execute?
  - How many people exist in a pair?

Algorithm provides that:
  - No one will be selected in a row (If it is forced code crashes)
  - Everybody will be selected nearly equal times
